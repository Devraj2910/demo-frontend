# Digital Kudos Wall - Project Setup

## Project Overview

The Digital Kudos Wall is a web application designed to foster a culture of appreciation by allowing colleagues to publicly recognize each other's achievements and contributions. This document outlines our implementation approach, tech stack, development steps, and innovative features that will help our solution outshine competitors.

## Core Requirements Implementation

### 1. Web Application

We'll develop a responsive web application with a clean, modern UI that's both functional and visually appealing:

- Single-page application for smooth user experience
- Mobile-responsive design from the start
- Intuitive UX focused on simplicity

### 2. User Roles

Implementation of three distinct user roles:

- **Admin**: Complete system access with user management capabilities and analytics oversight
- **Tech Lead**: Access to create and view kudos
- **Team Member**: Restricted to viewing kudos only
- Role assignment during user registration with email domain validation

### 3. Kudos Entry System

A streamlined kudos creation form with:

- Recipient Name field with typeahead search
- Team Name dropdown with predefined values
- Category selection (Teamwork, Innovation, Helping Hand, etc.)
- Rich text editor for meaningful recognition messages
- Preview functionality before submission

### 4. Kudos Wall

An engaging, interactive wall displaying all kudos with:

- Card-based layout with modern design
- Advanced filtering system (recipient, team, category)
- Search functionality with highlighted results
- Sort options (newest, most liked, etc.)
- Infinite scroll for performance

### 5. Authentication

Secure email/password-based authentication:

- Company email validation with domain restrictions
- Password strength requirements
- JWT-based session management
- Password hashing with bcrypt
- CSRF protection

### 6. Layered Architecture

We'll implement a clean, maintainable architecture for the frontend:

#### Frontend

1. **Presentation Layer**: React components, styled with Tailwind CSS
2. **State Management Layer**: Redux Toolkit for global state
3. **API Integration Layer**: Axios with interceptors for API communication

### 7. Analytics Dashboard

Comprehensive analytics with interactive visualizations:

- Recognition leaderboards (individuals and teams)
- Time-based filtering (weekly, monthly, quarterly, yearly)
- Trending keywords and categories with NLP analysis
- Interactive charts and graphs (bar charts, line charts, heatmaps)
- Exportable reports in CSV/PDF formats

### 8. Automated Testing

Focused testing strategy:

- Unit tests for components and utilities
- Integration tests for critical features
- Mock API responses for testing

## Tech Stack

### Frontend

- **Framework**: NextJS with TypeScript
- **State Management**: Redux Toolkit
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with custom theme
- **UI Components**: Shadcn UI components
- **Charts/Visualization**: Recharts + D3.js for advanced visualizations
- **Form Management**: React Hook Form + Zod validation
- **Testing**: Jest, React Testing Library

### DevOps

- **Containerization**: Docker + Docker Compose
- **Deployment**: Docker Compose for demo

## Development Roadmap

- [ ] Create kudos creation forms
- [ ] Build mock data services
- [ ] Develop basic UI components

### Phase 3: Kudos Wall & UI (Day 2 Morning)

- [ ] Build interactive kudos wall
- [ ] Implement search and filtering
- [ ] Design and implement kudos cards
- [ ] Add responsive layouts
- [ ] Create Admin and Tech Lead dashboards

### Phase 4: Analytics & Refinement (Day 2 Afternoon)

- [ ] Implement data visualization components
- [ ] Add final polish and animations
- [ ] Add unit tests for critical components
- [ ] Prepare deployment for demo

## Innovative Features to Outshine Competition

### 1. Real-time Celebration Effects

When someone receives kudos, we'll display personalized celebratory animations on their dashboard using Lottie animations. This creates a delightful moment of recognition.

### 2. Interactive Kudos Heatmap

A GitHub-style heatmap visualization showing when kudos activity peaks occur, helping identify patterns in recognition and team morale.

### 3. Semantic Analysis & Word Cloud

Using mock NLP analysis, we'll display dynamic word clouds highlighting common themes and values, providing insights into what's valued most in the company culture.

### 4. Value-Based Rotating Leaderboards

Weekly/monthly leaderboards that highlight different company values each cycle (innovation one week, teamwork the next), ensuring diverse types of contributions get recognized.

### 5. Team Momentum Tracking

Beyond simple counting, we'll implement algorithms to track acceleration of kudos to identify teams that are improving rapidly, not just those with high absolute numbers.

### 6. Recognition Streaks & Gamification

Track and reward users who consistently give recognition with badges and achievements, encouraging regular appreciation and building habits.

### 7. Company Values Alignment Dashboard

Analyze kudos content to show how team appreciation aligns with company values, providing leadership with insights into cultural health.

### 8. Customizable Kudos Templates

Allow Tech Leads to choose from different visual templates when giving kudos, with themes that match the type of recognition being given.

### 9. Slack-Inspired Reactions

Allow users to react to kudos with emojis, adding another dimension of engagement and recognition.

### 10. Email Digest & Notifications

Optional weekly digest emails summarizing recent kudos and highlighting achievements across teams.

## Implementation Best Practices

### Code Organization

- Feature-based folder structure
- Strict typing with TypeScript interfaces
- Comprehensive documentation with JSDoc
- Component storybook for UI components
- Clean code principles and consistent styling

### Testing Strategy

- Unit testing for core components
- Integration testing for component interactions
- Mock API responses for data-dependent components

### Performance Optimization

- Code splitting and lazy loading
- Image optimization
- Virtualized lists for large datasets
- Memoization for expensive calculations
- Efficient state management with selectors
